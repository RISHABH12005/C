# *C*

A *general-purpose programming language* that provides *low-level access* to memory & system resources. It is widely used for developing *operating systems, embedded systems,* & *performance-critical applications.*

## *Key Features*
- *Structured Language*: Supports *modular programming* through functions.
- *Low-Level Access*: Direct *memory manipulation* using pointers.
- *Fast Execution*: *Compiled language* with minimal runtime overhead.
- *Portability*: Can run on various *hardware architectures* with minimal changes.
- *Extensive Libraries*: Standard libraries provide support for *file handling, memory management* & *data structures.*

## *Applications*
- *OS*: *Linux, Windows,* & *macOS* components are built using C.
- *Embedded Sys*: Used in *microcontrollers* & *IoT devices.*
- *GameD*: Game engines utilize C for *high-performance computations.*
- *Compiler Development*: Many *compilers* for different languages are written in C.
- *Networking*: *Network protocols* & *applications* rely on C for *efficient data processing.*

## *Memory Management*
C provides *manual memory management,* allowing developers to allocate & free memory as needed. Key functions include:
- *malloc()*: Allocates *dynamic memory.*
- *calloc()*: Allocates & *initializes memory blocks.*
- *realloc()*: Resizes an *allocated memory block.*
- *free()*: Deallocates *previously allocated memory.*

Proper *memory management* is crucial in C to prevent *memory leaks* & ensure *efficient use* of system resources.

## *Data Structures*
C supports various *data structures* that help in *organizing* & *managing data efficiently:*
- *Arrays*: Store *multiple values* of the same type.
- *Structures*: Group *different types* of variables under a single entity.
- *Linked Lists*: *Dynamic data structure* with efficient insertions & deletions.
- *Stacks & Queues*: Used in *algorithms* & *memory management.*
- *Binary Trees*: Efficiently *store* & *retrieve hierarchical data.*

## *Debugging*
Debugging is an essential skill in C. Common debugging techniques include:
- *printf() Statements*: Print *variable values* to track program execution.
- *GDB (GNU Debugger)*: Helps in *step-by-step execution* of C.
- *Valgrind*: Detects *memory leaks* & *performance issues.*
- *Code Reviews*: Identifying *logical errors* through *peer reviews* & *testing.*
